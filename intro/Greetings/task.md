# Greetings with named and default parameters

Create a function named `createGreeting`.

### Input:
The function should take two parameters:
- **name**: a `String` that represents the name of the person to greet.
- **occasion**: a `String` that represents the occasion, with a default value of **"day"**.


### Result:
The function should return a greeting message (`String`) that includes the name and the occasion, in the format: **"Hello, _name_! Have a great _occasion_!"**

If the occasion is not specified, the function should use the default value.

## Self-Validation Checklist

_Only look at this section after you have attempted to solve the task._

<div class="hint">
Ensure your function satisfies the following requirements:

* [ ] Have you used named parameters for `name` and `occasion`?
* [ ] Have you provided a default value for the `occasion` parameter?
* [ ] Did you use string interpolation?
* [ ] What happens if you inverse the parameters, how can you call the function with a default value for the first parameter?
